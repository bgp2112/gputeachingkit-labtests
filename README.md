# gputeachingkit-labtests
These scripts are used to test the lab code for the gpu teaching kit. They run the solution code against all the datasets generated by the datasetgenerator for each lab with the appropriate input parameters.
The scripts would typically be run from the directory they reside in, the build-dir directory and the path to the datasets is relative to this "pwd" unless an alternate path is provided on the command line.
